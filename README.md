# Conversational AI Intents

## ðŸ¤– Introduction
This is a collection of Intents for building CAI (Conversational AI) Virtual Assistants, either demos or MVPs.
Some of the initial files will be taken from other GitHub repositories and those will be documented here.

Since every platform seems to use a different data format, these will be initally formatted as csv files.

I hope to script tools to convert those CSV files into various other formats for other platforms.

## Planned Sets
- E-Commerce
- IT Support
- Insurance
